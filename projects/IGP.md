<h1>Everything in Code</h1>

<h3>I coded everything for this game. From the frontend of the UI to the backend of the game mechanics.</h3>

As a person with full control and structure of the code, I used seperation of concern (SOC) to put code in reasonable places where it is appropriate for the object. I make use of alarm and other built in GameMaker tools to help me create this game.
